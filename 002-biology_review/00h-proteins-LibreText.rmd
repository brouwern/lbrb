Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all **macromolecules**. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, **polymers** of **amino acids**, arranged in a linear sequence.

## Types and Functions of Proteins

**Enzymes**, which are produced by living cells, are **catalysts** in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called **catabolic enzymes**, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called **anabolic enzymes**, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called **catalytic enzymes**. 
<!-- TODO: is this terminology standard?  -->
It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which
hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.

**Hormones** are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a **protein hormone** that helps to regulate the blood glucose level.

Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are **globular** in shape whereas others are fibrous. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as **denaturation**. All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of **amino acids**.

<!-- shoutout to non-canonical AAs? -->

## Amino Acids

Amino acids are the **monomers** that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of a central carbon atom, also known as the alpha (*α*) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH~2~), a carboxyl group (COOH), and to a hydrogen atom. Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as the R group (Figure 3.4.1).

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap="Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain (R group) are attached."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage1.jpeg"))
```

The name "amino acid" is derived from the fact that they contain both an amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic structure. For each amino acid, the R group (or side chain) is different (Figure 3.4.2).
<!-- As mentioned, there are 20 amino acids present in proteins. Ten of these are considered essential amino acids in humans because the human body cannot produce them and they are obtained from the diet.  Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids are necessary as well. They are
known as essential amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential amino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins in the body, although not produced by the body; which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.-->



```{r, echo = F,  out.width = '60%', fig.cap="There are 20 common amino acids commonly found in proteins, each with a different R group (variant group) that determines its chemical nature."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage2.jpeg"))
```

<!-- TODO:awk transition -->
Which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on the surface
of a soluble protein, and which would you expect to find in the
interior? What distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in
a protein embedded in a lipid bilayer?

The chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is **acidic**, **basic**, **polar**, or **nonpolar**). For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an amino acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain 
<!-- (Figure 3.4.2). -->

Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known by the letter V or the three-letter code val. 

The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein's shape, size, and function. Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a **peptide bond**, which is formed by a dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of water. The resulting bond is the peptide bond 
<!-- (Figure 3.4.3). -->

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap="Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked to the amino group of the incoming amino acid. In the process, a molecule of water is released."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage3.jpeg"))
```

The products formed by such linkages are called **peptides**. As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a **polypeptide**. Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. This end is called the **N-terminal**, or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C- or carboxyl
terminal.  The terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is more formally used for a polypeptide or  that have combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function.
<!-- is this a standard definition? -->



After **protein synthesis (translation)**, most proteins are modified. These are known as **post-translational modifications**. They may undergo **cleavage**, **phosphorylation** (addition of a phosphate group), or may require the addition of other chemical groups. Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.

## Evolution Connection:

---------------

**The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome**: Cytochrome c is an
important component of the electron transport chain, a part of
cellular respiration, and it is normally found in the cellular
organelle, the mitochondrion. This protein has a heme prosthetic
group, and the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced and
oxidized during electron transfer. Because this essential protein's
role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very
little over millions of years. Protein sequencing has shown that there
is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence **homology**
among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be
assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various
species' DNA or protein sequences.

Scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino
acids. For each cytochrome c molecule from different organisms that
has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same
position in all samples of cytochrome c. This indicates that there may
have been a **common ancestor**. On comparing the human and chimpanzee
protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and
rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was
in one amino acid. In another comparison, human to yeast sequencing
shows a difference in the 44th position.

## Protein Structure

The shape of a protein is critical to its function. For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at a site known as the **active site**. If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

### Primary Structure

The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its
primary structure. For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has two
polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide
bonds. The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is glycine, whereas
the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.4.4). The sequences
of amino acids in the A and B chains are unique to insulin.


```{r, echo = F,out.width = '40%', fig.cap="Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone made of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30 amino acids long). In each chain, primary structure is indicated by three-letter abbreviations that represent the names of the amino acids in the order they are present. The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond. Two disulfide bonds connect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the correct shape. Note that all disulfide bonds are the same length, but are drawn different sizes for clarity."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage4.jpeg"))
```

The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the
gene encoding the protein. A change in nucleotide sequence of the
gene's coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to
the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure
and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin *beta* chain (a small
portion of which is shown in Figure 3.4.5) has a single amino acid
substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function.
Specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in
the beta chain. What is most remarkable to consider is that a
hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains
that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore,
has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal
hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule---which dramatically
decreases life expectancy---is a single amino acid of the 600. What is
even more remarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by
three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base
change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases.


```{r, echo = F,out.width = '40%', fig.cap="The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to sickle cell anemia. In normal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate. In sickle cell hemoglobin, this glutamate is replaced by a valine."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage5.jpeg"))
```



Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin
molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or disc-shaped,
red blood cells and assume a crescent or "sickle" shape, which clogs
arteries (Figure 3.4.6). This can lead to myriad serious health
problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal
pain for those affected by this disease.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '60%',fig.cap="In this blood smear, visualized at 535x magnification using bright field microscopy, sickle cells are crescent shaped, while normal cells are disc-shaped. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage6.jpeg"))
```

### Secondary Structure

The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the
secondary structure of the protein. The most common are the *α*-helix
and *beta*-pleated sheet structures (Figure 3.4.7). Both structures are
the *α*-helix structure---the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds.
The hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group
in one amino acid and another amino acid that is four amino acids
farther along the chain.

```{r, echo = F,out.width = '40%', fig.cap="The α-helix and β-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone. Certain amino acids have a propensity to form an α-helix, while others have a propensity to form a β-pleated sheet."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage7.jpeg"))
```

Every helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues. The
R groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide protrude out from the
*α*-helix chain. In the *beta*-pleated sheet, the "pleats" are formed by
hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide
chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and
below the folds of the pleat. The pleated segments align parallel or
antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the
partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially
negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide backbone.
The *α*-helix and *beta*-pleated sheet structures are found in most
globular and fibrous proteins and they play an important structural
role.

### Tertiary Structure

The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its
tertiary structure (Figure 3.4.8). This structure is in part due to
chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the
interactions among R groups creates the complex three- dimensional
tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in
the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen
bonds described for standard secondary structures. For example, R
groups with like charges are repelled by each other and those with
unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When protein
folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids
lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups
lay on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as
hydrophobic interactions. Interaction between cysteine side chains
forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent
bond forming during protein folding.

```{r, echo = F,out.width = '40%', fig.cap="The tertiary structure of proteins is determined by a variety of chemical interactions. These include hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding and disulfide linkages."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage8.jpeg"))
```

All of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the final
three-dimensional shape of the protein. When a protein loses its
three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.

### Quaternary Structure

In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also
known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the
quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to
stabilize the overall structure. For example, insulin (a globular
protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that
cause it to be mostly clumped into a ball shape. Insulin starts out as
a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence
of post-translational modification after the formation of the
disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together. Silk (a
fibrous protein), however, has a *beta*-pleated sheet structure that is
the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.

The four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary,
and quaternary) are illustrated in Figure 3.4.9.

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap="The four levels of protein structure can be observed in these illustrations. (credit: modification of work by National Human Genome Research Institute)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/protimage9.jpeg"))
```


## Denaturation and Protein Folding

Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that are held
together by chemical interactions. If the protein is subject to
changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein
structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary
sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often
reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is
conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing
the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is
irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible
protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in
the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all
proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria
that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at
temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a
low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process;
however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity
under these conditions.

Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought
that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process.
Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the
folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or
chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding
process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make
up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the
protein once the target protein is folded.

## Summary

Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of
functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing
structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones.
The building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids. Each amino
acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl
group, a hydrogen atom, and an

R group or side chain. There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids,
each of which differs in the R group. Each amino acid is linked to its
neighbors by a peptide bond. A long chain of amino acids is known as a
polypeptide.

Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary,
and (optional) quaternary. The primary structure is the unique
sequence of amino acids. The local folding of the polypeptide to form
structures such as the *α* helix and *beta*-pleated sheet constitutes the
secondary structure. The overall three-dimensional structure is the
tertiary structure. When two or more polypeptides combine to form the
complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the
quaternary structure of a protein. Protein shape and function are
intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in
temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in
function.

## Art Connections

* Which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on
the surface of a soluble protein, and which would you expect to find
in the interior? What distribution of amino acids would you expect to
find in a protein embedded in a lipid bilayer?

* Polar and charged amino acid residues (the remainder after
peptide bond formation) are more likely to be found on the surface of
soluble proteins where they can interact with water, and nonpolar
(e.g., amino acid side chains) are more likely to be found in the
interior where they are sequestered from water. In membrane proteins,
nonpolar and hydrophobic amino acid side chains associate with the
hydrophobic tails of phospholipids, while polar and charged amino acid
side chains interact with the polar head groups or with the aqueous
solution. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes, positively and
negatively charged amino acid side chains interact with one another in
the interior of a protein, and polar or charged amino acid side chains
that interact with a ligand can be found in the ligand binding pocket.

## Free Response

**Explain what happens if even one amino acid is substituted for another
in a polypeptide chain. Provide a specific example.**

A change in gene sequence can lead to a different amino acid being
added to a polypeptide chain instead of the normal one. This causes a
change in protein structure and function. For example, in sickle cell
anemia, the hemoglobin *beta* chain has a single amino acid
substitution---the amino acid glutamic acid in position six is
substituted by valine. Because of this change, hemoglobin molecules
form aggregates, and the disc-shaped red blood cells assume a crescent
shape, which results in serious health problems.

**Describe the differences in the four protein structures.**

The sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its
primary structure. The local folding of the polypeptide in some
regions is the secondary structure of the protein. The
three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary
structure, created in part by chemical interactions such as hydrogen
bonds between polar side chains, van der Waals interactions, disulfide
linkages, and hydrophobic interactions. Some proteins are formed from
multiple polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of
these subunits forms the quaternary structure.
